Typhoid fever is still widespread in developing nations, despite the fact that antibiotics have significantly decreased its prevalence in the developed world. It's possible that S paratyphi infections are becoming more common than S- typhi infections. This might be brought on by the immunologic immaturity of a particular population as well as the insufficient protection against these pathogens offered by the current Typhoid vaccinations. The gastroenteritis caused by non-Typhoidal strains is often mild and self-limiting.",
